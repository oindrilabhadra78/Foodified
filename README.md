### Impact on Society
Most people in our society are very conscious about their health. But they fail to keep track of the number of calories they have consumed and the number that they have utilised. Foodified is a solution to such problems. People can keep track of the number of calories they have consumed, calories they have lost by working out, walking indoors and outdoors. Foodified also gives proper suggestions regarding what to eat next by using advanced algorithms. This app will help people to maintain a proper and healthy lifestyle. People can also share their experience with their friends. This would spread health awareness in the society.
